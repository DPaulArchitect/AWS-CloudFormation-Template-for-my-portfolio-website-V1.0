This is the cloud formation template of my previous Website version, i found that it was very basic and bare though i have made it available for those who wish to recreate one for themselves. 
It features:
-a dark mode,
-blog posting,
-AWS news feed,
-View counter.
you can use the other templates in my repos for the functionality. please see the , View counter template, AWS S3 upload to website, AWS news. though you can easily create your own if you wish.
